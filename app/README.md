## Overview 

This section holds all of the projects python scripts that will be needed to convert the models, run performance testing, and all other functionality. This will grow as the project expands.

## Milestones
This section will display the milestones and also tell which files satisfy each milestone and how. 

### Phase 1 (Resource Contraints, Models, and Exporting to Onnx)

#### Selected Models 
1. CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4 for Stable Diffusion and Image generation
2. openai-community/gpt2-medium for Text prompt Generation

#### Resource Contraints 
1. Due to needed memory/cpu usage and size of the stable-diffusion model resource contraints include available RAM and CPU as long as how much space we need on the device to store the models. 

#### Possible Optimizations
Since we are concerned with the size of the model along with the needed memory/cpu usage we can do a few things to help with this. 
1. Model Quantization to reduce the size of the models.
2. Pruning/KV cachine for gpt model for better optimization
3. Reducing UNET timesteps and sample sizing to reduce cpu and memory load (tradeoff is reduced quality in generated image).

#### General design of full demo
1. Export Models to Onnx
2. Ask the User to input a word or phrase that they want to be generated into a creative prompt
3. The prompt is outputted and then sent to the image generator
4. The image is generated by the stable diffusion model
5. The user is then prompted to choose which item they want to edit from the picture
6. Image detection model creates a mask of the image.
7. User is prompted to tell what they want the edit to do (Ex. Change Color)
8. Picture is edited and saved for user to view.

#### Files that contain benchmarking and onnx export for 1st Milestone.
1. stable_diffusion_to_onnx_64px_quantized.py
2. gpt2_pruned_vs_base.py
3. *** convert_gpt2_to_onnx.py 

Both of these first two files have basic onnx exporting and benchmarking and then compares them against the optimized versions as well. These started out as the original onnx export and benchmarking but have changed throughout the process to now contain most of the milestones goals in each one. 

*** convert_gpt2_to_onnx.py is one of the first tests I created and does display a nice UI output of benchmarking so I will also add that here (it is also displayed below in the current files tab) but it is not as far along as the other two. 

### Phase 2-3 (Optimization for text generation and image generation models)
I grouped these together as it worked out for me that my first two selected models were actually needed for these sections. So I will discuss some of the steps I took and the outputs.

#### Files that contain Optimization and benchmarking
1. stable_diffusion_to_onnx_64px_quantized.py
2. gpt2_pruned_vs_base.py

As I said before both of these files have been updated throughout the process so they again pertain to this certain phase. 

##### Optimizing Text generation model (GPT2)
For the text generation model I used pruning and kv caching to optimize the text generation in this file and then compared the outputs of both to compare the results.

- Pruning:

-KV caching:

Both of these optimizations did help in terms of speed and resources but it badly affected the quality of the generated text from what I saw. Using no optimization techniques my text generation stayed on track and produced rather good creative outputs but with the optimization it struggled to stay on topic and usually drifted into typing nonsense. I even tried some repetition handling and warnings where it would basically tell the model it was wrong for having repition in its outputs and that still did not help. That is why these files are seperate from the full demo as the tradeoff for the functionality was not worth it from what I saw in my examples. So, I decided to stick with the base model with no optimization for the full demo but did keep them  in these other filesfor benchmarking purposes. 

Example Benchmark output from gpt2_pruned_vs_base.py:


##### Optimizing Stable Diffusion Image Generator
For the image generation model I used quantization and then also downgraded some of the UNET model's values to help with the optimization here.

- Quantization:

  Due to the stable diffusion model having separate pipelines we have to quantize each one separatley (text_encoder, unet, vae). So this is an example of the code calling each one to quantize them. 

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2c068ba-426a-4215-a172-9a2fb9c256c4)

  Each one calls the quantize static function (quantize dynamic was causing issues so swapped) and I am created calibration data for each input as well

- Unet values:
  I downgraded the UNET values to help with cpu/memory usage as well. I changed the timesteps to be 50 and the sample size down to 64x64 to help with the resources.

 Once again using these techniques I was able to reduce resources needed and also reduce the size of the model files but the tradeoff was that the quality of the image that was generated was greatly affected. With quantization the image looked like smeared paint and     then without quantization and just the 64x64 sample size would create a fairly decent image but again at a drastically reduced quality. In the stable_diffusion_64px_quantized.py file I have kept the quantization for benchmarking to compare the regular to quantized    models but in the full demo I made the trade off of no quantization but kept the 64x64 sample size as the image is viewable and does not take 20 minutes plus to create. 

 Example output from stable_diffusion_to_onnx_64px_quantized.py:





## Current files

### convert_gpt2_to_onnx.py
This script converts the openai-community/gpt2 huggingface model to onnx and then runs through 100 tests to create a performance report so that we  can see exactly how the model is performing on the system.

Example output:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc48c495-2554-49f7-a1de-810498503b82)



### convert_diffusion_to_onnx_with_stats.py
This scirpt converts the  huggingface model to onnx and then runs through creating an image based on the prompt given and gives a performance report so that we can see how the model is performing on the system. It also gives the CLIP score to determine how accurate the image is based on the prompt given.
